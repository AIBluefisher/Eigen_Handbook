# Eigen Handbook
The aim of this handbook is to get people started with Eigen quickly.
Some of the documentation is referenced to [Eigen3.2 Documentation](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox-3.2/). This handbook only related with Eigen3.2, though Eigen3.3 has been released by the official, `segmentation fault` has always been a puzzle when used in other libraries(i,e. Ceres) and is not recommended right now. (I'll see if this issue can be handled later).

For more users to get started with Eigen, I provide both Eiglish version and Chinese version.

Get familiar with eigen operations and some advanced grammar can help us develop high-performance
applications, like `SLAM` or `SfM`.
