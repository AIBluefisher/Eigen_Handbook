# Eigen Handbook
The aim of this handbook is to get people started with Eigen quickly.
Some of the documentation is referred to [Eigen3.2 Documentation](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox-3.2/). This handbook only related with Eigen3.2, though Eigen3.3 has been released by the official, `segmentation fault` has always been a puzzle when used in other libraries(i,e. Ceres) and is not recommended right now. (I'll see if this issue can be handled later).

For more users to get started with Eigen, I provide both Eiglish version and Chinese version.

Get familiar with eigen operations and some advanced grammar can help us develop high-performance
applications, like `SLAM` or `SfM`.

The chapters is organized as following:
- [Chapter1: About Eigen]() [[CN (TODO)](CN/chap1_about_eigen.md) | [EN](EN/chap1_about_eigen.md)]
- [Chapter2: Eigen Types]() [[CN (TODO)](CN/chap2_eigen_types.md) | [EN](EN/chap2_eigen_types.md)]
- [Chapter3: Basic Operations]() [[CN (TODO)](CN/chap3_basic_operations.md) | [EN](EN/chap3_basic_operations.md)]
- [Chapter4: Advanced Operations]() [[CN (TODO)](CN/chap4_advanced_operations.md) | [EN](EN/chap4_advanced_operations.md)]
- [Chapter5: More Eigen Skills]() [[CN (TODO)](CN/chap5_more.md) | [EN](EN/chap5_more.md)]
